			    <p>In web design, there are two ways you can use custom fonts so that everyone can see them on their computer. One is to host your own web font. The second is to find a similar font on Google Web Fonts.</p>
			    <p>This font isn’t available on Google Web Fonts. Practice finding a similar substitute font in Google Web Fonts by looking closely at the shapes.</p>

			    <p>You may remember the grid from previous design courses. As a web designer and developer, the grid is a critical part of your workflow. You’ll often have a predefined grid you’re working with, and you’ll want to align your design with it.</p>
			    <p>In Figma, select this frame (Practice 1b) and find Layout Grid in your right panel. Use the eye to turn on the grid. Notice how the text aligns to each grid line, and how large each grid section is. Then, select the frame Two Column, and find Auto Layout in the right panel. It will show a down arrow. Change that setting to the right arrow, and notice how this text changes position.</p>
